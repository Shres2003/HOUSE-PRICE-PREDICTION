The goal of this project is to develop a regression model that can predict the price of a house based on input features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The project covers the complete pipeline from data cleaning to model evaluation and optimization.

🛠 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ML Algorithm: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso

IDE: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

🎯 Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on housing data

Preprocess data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables

Train and test multiple regression models

Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning

Evaluate model accuracy using proper metrics

🗂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle Housing Dataset or custom dataset

Features Include:

Square footage

Number of bedrooms/bathrooms

Location

Age of the house

Garage and amenities

🔁 Workflow
Data Cleaning – Handling missing/null values, outliers

Feature Engineering – Encoding categorical data, scaling numerical features

Model Training – Applying Linear Regression and regularization techniques

Model Evaluation – RMSE, MAE, and cross-validation scores

Visualization – Correlation heatmaps, residual plots, feature importances

🌟 Key Features
Easy-to-follow modular code

Real-world dataset with multiple features

Evaluation and comparison of multiple regression models

Visual representation of predictions vs. actuals
